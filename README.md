Tip: 
- The business pages all have the same or similar layout, so you can use the same components for them. I recommend that you make one template component page that will be used for all the business pages. (NOTE: Some business pages have certificates to display, so for these pages you will need to add a bottom component specific to that template page. If any questions, ask me)
