                With growth comes responsibility. In 2020, Paragon launched its first organic fertilizer project. Channeling all organic waste to this project, Paragon takes another step toward improving its ecological footprint with another environmentally friendly initiative.

              <p className="text-md text-justify text-gray-600">
                Paragon designed an organic fertilizer using technology that improves soil texture, holds water longer, increases bacterial and fungal activity in the soil, improves nutrient efficiency, and produces more robust crops. It facilitates the slow release of nutrients based on the dynamic needs of plants, boosts water efficiency, safeguards ecosystems by minimizing leaching, and helps the soil become more fertile for future crops.
