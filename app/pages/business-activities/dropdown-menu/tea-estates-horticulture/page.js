                Established in 1993, Paragon Poultry is one of the top three
                poultry farmers in Bangladesh. Our farms are strategically
                located across the country in remote areas, away from biological
                hazards and pollution to facilitate the best environment for
                high-quality day-old poultry.

                Furthermore, we also produce commercial layers and broilers for
                direct consumers to ensure safe, sustainable poultry meat and
                eggs.
